# microservice-friends-quiz

Welcome to this quiz application. This is a microservices artitechture based web application. The frameworks used here are: Node and Express along with Databases: MongoDB and Mongoose.

I have used 2 microservices,  
First microservice: Quiz service that is my main page which allows user to enter into the game by giving name input.

Second microservice: Certification service that is my certificate generation page for the user after playing the quiz.

Database is used here to store the names of the user playing and at the end it is retrived from the MongoDB server in the certification page.

This web app is also deployed on GCloud platform with a public URL.

Hope You enjoy playing this game with your friends and family.
